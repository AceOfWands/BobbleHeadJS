# BobbleHeadJS

BobbleHeadJS is a pure-Javascript framework that uses HTML5, CSS and Javascript to generate web applications. It realizes a View-Controller system where you can create front-ends in a really fast and simple way, by common web languages, and interact from it with your custom defined controller logic. It simplifies the building of applications providing ready-to-use resources useful to resolve most common app development problems.
